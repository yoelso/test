# test
To create total coverage tests for the PrivateBank contract using the Truffle framework, we first need to set up the development environment with Truffle and write the corresponding tests in JavaScript.

### Truffle Project Setup

**Installation of Truffle and Ganache**  
If we donâ€™t have Truffle and Ganache installed, we first need to install them globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

**Initializing the Truffle Project**

```bash
mkdir PrivateBank
cd PrivateBank
truffle init
```

**Writing the Solidity Contract**  
Save your Solidity contract in `contracts/PrivateBank.sol`.

**Contract Migration**  
Create the migration file in `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`:

```javascript
const PrivateBank = artifacts.require("PrivateBank");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(PrivateBank);
};
```

**Total Coverage Tests**  
Create the test file in `test/privateBank.test.js`.

**Running the Tests**  
Run Ganache CLI in a separate terminal:

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Then, in the project terminal, compile and run the tests:

```bash
truffle compile
truffle migrate
truffle test
```

These steps set up the project, deploy the contract, and run total coverage tests to ensure that all functions of the PrivateBank contract behave as expected.
